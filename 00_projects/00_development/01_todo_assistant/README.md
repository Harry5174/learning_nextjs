# Next.js Todo Frontend

This Next.js frontend serves as the user interface for a Todo application. It interacts with a FastAPI backend to manage todo items stored in a database.

## Description

This project provides an intuitive user interface for managing todo items. Users can view existing todos, add new todos, update existing ones, and delete them as needed. The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to perform these operations.

## Getting Started

First, clone both the frontend and backend repositories:

1. Clone the frontend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-todo-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nextjs-todo-frontend
   ```

3. Clone the backend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harry5174/learning_generative_ai.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the backend project directory:

   ```bash
   cd learning_generative_ai/01_microservices_all_in_one_platform/00_python_poetry/00_poetry_projects/02_fastapi_todo_poetry_sqlmodel
   ```

### Setup Frontend

1. Navigate back to the frontend project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../../../../../
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
